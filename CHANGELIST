# 0.0-15
1. Adding samples & taxa functions
2. Fixed glitch in clean when only one variable in map
3. Mainteinance for heatgg function. Now there is an appropriate class and print method for when
clusering is used. Also documentation was moved to roxygen and updated. Old code was removed.
4. plotgg mainteinance. Now plots proportion of variance in the indicated axis, and value of PCO
function now has dimension names in the points variable.
5. Created variables function, and updated documentation for samples & taxa.
6. Mainteinance to the basic Dataset functions. Moved some functions from AMOR.r to create_dataset.r,
and added a Dataset print method.
7. Added simplify option to read.am
8. Replaced findGoodOTUs with measurable_taxa function.

# 0.0-14
1. Added space option to phylogram
2. Set width in geom_bar of phylogram to 1.
3. Added summary and print methods for PCA and PCO
4. Continued switching documentation to roxygen
5. Added README

# 0.0-13
1. Added subset.Dataset method.
2. Changed clean function, now it cheks that all the entries in a row/column are equal to zero to remove. Slighlty slower but more general.

# 0.0-12
1. read.am always returns a Dataset object. Documented
2. Added Dataset method for write.qiime and homogenized variable names. Documented

# 0.0-11
1. fixed glitched where MASS package was not being loaded and one couldn't use the matrix_glmNB function.
2. remove_samples now applies droplevels by default, and can be turned of by the user.
3. Added functions plotgg_var and plotgg_taxon which make boxplots of a variable in the mapping file or a taxon in the abundance matrix.
4. Now the pool_samples function return Dataset objects
5. Added plotgg_rankabun function and Dataset methods.
6. Also added experimental function plotgg_rankabun2
7. Improved phylogram function to return only plot and now it can also take an argument for showing only the top n taxa, and collapsing the rest. Also added Datast method for it.
8. Fixed glitch in PCA function. Totvar was not being calculated
9. Fixed glitch in remove_samples functiin, now it can handle Dataset onjects with NULL map.
10. Added ggdendro dependency which is required for the heatgg function
11. Addedd heatgg function with support for sample faceting and 2D clustering.
12. Added site_diversity functions and a plotgg method for it.

# 0.0-10
1. fixed bug in pool_samples. The test set was always being used.
2. read.am returns a dataset object if taxonomy is passed.
3. Fixed glitch in collapse_by_taxonomy help

# 0.0-9
1. Changed the PCA function, now it does not call pca from labdsv, but prcomp directly.
2. Changed PCO function, now it does not call pco, but cmdscale directly.
3. Fixed plotgg.PCA so that it returns all the data (including biplot) in the main object
4. Created PCO method for plotgg
5. Created clean, remove_samples and remove_taxons functions and docummented them.
6. Added Rhizo.tax as data distributed with the package
7. Added collapse_matrix functiona and documented it
8. labdsv now is suggested but not required. vegan is suggested as well.
9. Added collapse_by_taxonomy and documentation.
10. Added pool_samples and documented
11. Updated create_dataset to make both Map and Tab optional

# 0.0-8
1. Added matrix_glmNB function
2. Change pca and pco functions to PCA and PCO so they don't interfere with labdsv.
They are just wrappers for the labdsv functions. Documented both.
3. Function PCA was modified so that the pca object returned by its Dataset method contains
Map and Tax slots.
4. plotgg generic function and plotgg.pca method created
5. Changed rrarefy function to rarefaction, and also altered so the columns are samples
now. Created S3 method for Dataset objects and documented.

# 0.0-7
1. Important mainteinance to matrix_glm and bootstrap_glm.
2. Docummentation improved (read.am, write.qiime)
3. Added data Rhizo and Rhizo.map
4. Added PCA and PCoA methods for Dataset objects. Relies ehavily in the labdsv package
5. Updated matrix_glm to take ... argument and pass it to glm. bootstrap_glm was modified
accordingly.
6. Updated matrix_glm to take return design matrix X.
7. Updated docummentation

# 0.0-6
1. Added create_dataset() function which defines the "Dataset" class
2. Added the matrix_glm methods, and documentation. Includes a summary
method and a print method for the summary.
3. Added the bootstrap_glm methods, and documentation. Includes a summary
method and a print method for the summary.
4. Expanded documentation

# 0.0-5
1. Fixed bug for specifying the number of rows in the legend.

# 0.0-4
1. Reorganized functions into files according to general purpose.
2. Added an option to specify the maximum number of rows in the legend
of the function phylogram.
3. Added function beta_diversity, which calculates Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
so we don't need the vegan function anymore.
4. Removed vegan from the list of dependencies.
